# Workflow From Chats

Infer durable working preferences from recent chats. Do not summarize chats; extract reusable workflow guidance.

## Scope

- Default to the last 7 days unless the user asks for a different window.
- Do not expose local transcript paths, secrets, customer data, private chat content, or credentials.

## Workflow

1. State the target workflow or preference surface in one paragraph.
2. Scan for explicit preferences, corrections, and workflow markers such as "I prefer", "always", "never", "not what I asked", "stop", "review", "PR", "CI", "logs", and "skill".
3. Extract preference atoms: trigger, workflow step, decision rule, quality bar, stop condition, evidence, and confidence.
4. Rate confidence as strong, medium, weak, or contradicted.
5. Cluster by workflow shape rather than transcript: shipping, review, simplification, debugging, capture, communication, delegation, or validation.
6. Choose the artifact: new skill, skill edit, rule, workflow doc, or no artifact.
7. Draft only the reusable guidance. Filter anecdotes that will not help future tasks.

## Confidence

- **Strong**: explicit user preference, workflow-changing correction, repeated pattern, or direct request to encode behavior.
- **Medium**: accepted workflow, repeated tool/model/validation preference, or pattern the user used successfully.
- **Weak**: agent-chosen behavior with no user feedback, one ambiguous transcript, or a likely task-specific correction.
- **Contradicted**: evidence points in incompatible directions; ask the user before writing files.

## Artifact Choice

- **Skill**: recurring multi-step workflow with clear triggers.
- **Rule**: general behavior that should apply broadly.
- **Workflow doc**: useful context that is not reliably triggerable.
- **No artifact**: situational, stale, or low-confidence observation.

## Output

Return a concise synthesis first:

- Target workflow.
- Evidence corpus with citations only.
- Preference profile.
- Adopt, consider, dismissed.
- Proposed artifacts.
- Open questions only if they block writing.
